export const FEEDBACK_PROMPT=`{{conversation}}

Based on this interview conversation between assistant and user, give me feedback for the user interview. 

IMPORTANT: Consider total number of questions, how many questions were asked by the assistant and how many were actually answered by the user. If the user did not answer most of the questions, or gave very short or incomplete answers, lower the ratings accordingly. Be strict about partial or missing answers.

Give me a rating out of 10 for Technical Skills, Communication, Problem Solving, and Experience. Also give me a summary in 3 lines about the interview and one line to let me know whether the candidate is recommended for hire or not, with a message. Give me the response in JSON format.
